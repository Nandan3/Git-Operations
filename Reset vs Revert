§ Git Reset vs Git Revert:

○ Git Reset:
	1. To undo the commits and keep those changes in the history.
	2. Git reset moves the branch pointer (HEAD) to a different commit.
	
	Eg:
	$git reset --soft HEAD~1          #undo last commit, keep changes staged
	
	$git reset --hard HEAD~1         #undo last commit and delete changes
	
○ Git Revert:
	1. Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.
	
	Eg:
	$git revert a1b2c3d
	#This creates a new commit that reverses the changes made by commit a1b2c3d.
	
	ü Common Scenarios:
		1. Accidentally committed too early → use git reset --soft HEAD~1.
		2. Want to discard uncommitted changes → use git reset --hard.
		3. Need to undo a bad commit that’s already pushed → use git revert <commit>.
		4. Fix broken production release → use git revert (safer).
